# notes on the modified chaos program

ok so. the output seems **just as chaotic** due to that there impreciseness (the true chaos here) making, say, 0.32 stored as 0.320000000000006 or w/e. this is a problem still, even *with* a very even number like 2.0 and a very simple input like 0.2.

it's wild, really.
